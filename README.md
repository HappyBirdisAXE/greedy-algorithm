# Greedy Algorithm

A greedy algorithm is an approach for solving a problem by selecting the best option available at the moment. It doesn't worry whether the current best result will bring the overall optimal result.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/hammadmajid/greedy-algorithm
```
2. Build the app 
```bash
$ make # or make compile
```
3. Test the app 
```bash
$ make test
```
4. Run the app 
```bash
$ make run
