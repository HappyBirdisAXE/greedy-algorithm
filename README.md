A greedy algorithm is an approach for solving a problem by selecting the best option available at the moment. It doesn't worry whether the current best result will bring the overall optimal result.

2. Open termianl and run the following commands:

    ```bash
    
    git clone https://github.com/hammads-archive/greedy-algorithm.git greedy-algorithm

    cd greedy-algorithm
    
    python main.py

    # Enter a postive number when programs prompts for change
    Change Owed: 

    # Program will output the minimum number of coins
    ```
